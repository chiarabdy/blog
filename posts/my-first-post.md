## Building with Components

One of the first things that clicked for me with React is its component-based architecture. Instead of thinking about a whole page, you break everything down into small, reusable pieces.

This makes complex UIs much more manageable. Our Kanban board project, for example, was built from small components:

- `Task`
- `Column`
- `AddTaskForm`

This approach keeps code organized and easy to debug.
